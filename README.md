# SMILES-X
Autonomous molecular compounds characterization for small datasets without descriptors

On arXiv:

## What is it?
The **SMILES-X** is an autonomous pipeline which **find best neural architectures to predict a physicochemical property from molecular SMILES only** (see [OpenSMILES](http://opensmiles.org/opensmiles.html)). **No human-engineered descriptors are needed.**

## Which kind of dataset can I use with it?
The SMILES-X is dedicated to **small datasets (<5000 samples) of (SMILES, experimental property)**

## What can I do with it?
With the SMILES-X, you can:
* **Find best architectures** fitted to your small dataset.
* **Predict molecular properties** of a list of SMILES based on models ensembling.
* **Interpret** a prediction by visualizing the salient elements and/or substructures most related to an inferred property
